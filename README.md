Alpha-Beta pruning for the game of tic-tac-toe
===========

Following a [tutorial on how to implement an alpha-beta heuristic search algorithm for the game of tic-tac-toe](http://bfj7.com/blog/alpha-beta-pruning.html)

Usage:

    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install --dependencies-only
    cabal run

It seems that the tutorial lacks the knowledge transfer that someone (like me)
might expect from it. There is some code, but sometimes it is hard to grasp
everything the author was trying to transfer as the comments in the post are not
sufficient. In the end we do not even get a working solution but something near
a finished state that could be used in a project of tic tac toe. But as the
author says in the end there is an issue that has to be addressed...
